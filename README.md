# code-and-project-examples
This repository is to show some of the SQL Server, Business Intelligence, JavaScript, Node.js and Angular projects and code samples that I have worked on.

Below is a list of files that are included in the respository, along with a breif description of what it contains.

***NOTE: All code samples and screenshots have been re-developed for this repository to use test sources/destinations in order to eliminate any sensitive data and give examples of real-life projects I have worked on.


SSIS_ExampleDocument
This Word document has screenshots of an SSIS package that I created for a daily data import/transformation for a data-warehouse. It shows examples of SSIS features such as Lookups, Slowly Changing Dimensions, OLD DB Commands, Error Destinations, Project Parameters, Expressions, Project Environments and C# Script Components.

This Word document has screenshots of an SSAS Tabular data model that I created from a data warehouse, which makes use of features such as Data Analysis Expressions, Table Hierarchies, Relationships and a Star Schema.


SSAS_MultiDimensional_ExampleDocument
This Word document has screenshots of an SSAS Multi-Dimensional analysis cube that I created from a data-warehouse, which makes use of features such as Relationships, Fact and Dimension tables and Data Mining Structures.


SqlExample_StoredProcWithSpatialData
This sql file is an example of a stored procedure that uses SQL geometry/spatial data to caluculate customers within a specific distance radius, using latitude/longitude points.
